What I really want to do here in the future or soon is SaaS, which will take care of creating testnet activities like galxe, social media, testnet interactions, the bot will take care of creating for the user and our platform is end to end and user friendly where the user is allowed to execute functions with difference networks at the same time like pharos testnet, its task activities are faucet, daily check in, swap, liquidity, transfer, deploy, then monad also has its own functions swap, liquidity, transfer, deploy and other tasks that are not in other testnets because testnet projects are different, it allows users to add multiple networks and multiple wallets that they want then once they run the bot it will execute everything at the same time all wallets provided and this project of ours will run 24/7 on a vps and has its own database like supabase then there are monthly subscriptions
